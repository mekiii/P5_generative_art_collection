# Generative art collection
Here's a collection of my explorations in the world of generative art mainly applied via P5. 

## Conways Game of Life
The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead, (or populated and unpopulated, respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.
