# Generative art collection
Here's a collection of my explorations in the world of generative art mainly applied via P5. 

## 0. Conways Game of Life
The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead, (or populated and unpopulated, respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.
## 1. Particle System
Inspired by chapter 4 of the book "Nature of Code" (by Daniel Shiffman, I highly recommend it!) I generated multiple particles, that float randomly on a 2D plane. Whenever each particle detects surrounding particles up to a certain distance, connecting lines will be drawn. Hence a beautiful star-like scenery is created. With tensorflow.js there are multiple possibilities to detect body movement without a depending hardware such as Microsoft's kinect. Hence I was curious to try out this new feature and used the handtracking.js library which is based on tensorflow. My goal is to create a fun particle animation where one can interact with it either with the hand movement or even a full body detection.
## 2. Voronoi
During my research of beautiful generative arts patterns I was fascinated by the voronoi pattern, that delivers a cell-like structure. Therefore I sketched a jiggling animation with it via P5 and a voronoi library.

## Background
During my last semester I was fulfilling a dream for me: Creating art via code.
