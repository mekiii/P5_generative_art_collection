# Generative art collection
Here's a collection of my explorations in the world of generative art mainly applied via [P5](https://p5js.org/). 

## Install
The installation is quite simple. After downloading or cloning the repository: Open the index.html file in a browser. 
You can switch between sketches via pressing the arrow keys left and right or by opening the Detailtab on the bottom right and clicking the arrows. 


## The sketches 
### 0. Conways Game of Life
The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead, (or populated and unpopulated, respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.

### 1. Particle System
Inspired by chapter 4 of the book "Nature of Code" I generated multiple particles, that float randomly on a 2D plane. Whenever each particle detects surrounding particles up to a certain distance, connecting lines will be drawn. Hence a star-like scenery is created. With tensorflow.js there are multiple possibilities to detect body movement without a depending hardware such as Microsoft's kinect. Hence I was curious to try out this new feature and used the handtracking.js library which is based on tensorflow. My goal is to create a fun particle animation where one can interact either with the hand movement or even a full body detection.
### 2. Voronoi
During my research of beautiful generative arts patterns I was fascinated by the voronoi pattern, that delivers a cell-like structure. Therefore I sketched a jiggling animation with it via P5 and a voronoi library.
### 3. Collatz Conjecture
The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.

### Background
During my last semester I was fulfilling a dream for me: Visualizing aesthetic patterns via code.
